# EDUCATION

## University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)-Sep.2020 ~ Jun.2024(expected)
* Major: Computer Science and Technology \| **GPA:3.93/4.00**
* Core course: The C/C++ Programming, Computer Operating System, Programming Languages and Compiling, Software Engineering, Principle and Application of Database, Principles of Computer Organization,  Computer Architecture.

# WORKING EXPERIENCE

## [Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co.Ltd](https://www.tencent.com/en-us) - Jun. 2022~Sep. 2022


*Intern Security Enginner*
  * Performed logical analysis towards more than 10 malicious software
  * Provided generally countermeasure recommendations.
  * Developed a sample software based on those analysed malicious software

# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

## Host Co-operate SSD filesystem - Dec. 2022 ~ present

* Profile: Developing a filesystem that coordinates between the host and SSD based on the existing new SSD with computing ability. By offloading certain operations to the SSD, we aim to reduce write amplification and alleviate bus transmission pressure, thereby optimizing IO performance in scenarios where computing resources are separated from storage resources.
* Duties included: Design of filesystem | Development of SSD simulation environment
* Supervisor: Dr. Li Lin

## Heterogeneous filesystem based on non-volatile memory - Nov. 2021 ~ Oct. 2022

* Profile: Combine traditional SSD storage media and
emerging NVM storage media, storing file metadata on NVM and file data on SSD separately to optimize filesystem
performance. Additionally, NVM also serves to offer buffer for writing.
* Duties included: Design and Implementation of filesystem | Development of SSD simulation environment
* Supervisor: Dr. Li Lin
